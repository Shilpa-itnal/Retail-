# 🛍️ Retail Business Performance & Profitability Analysis

This project analyzes retail transactional data to discover profit-draining categories, optimize inventory turnover, and identify seasonal product trends.

## 🚀 Tools Used
- SQL – data cleaning & aggregation  
- Python (Pandas, NumPy) – profitability and correlation analysis  
- Tableau – visualization dashboard  
- PowerPoint – presentation slides  

## 🧩 Steps Followed
1. Cleaned data in SQL and computed row-level profit & margin  
2. Aggregated by category/sub-category to detect loss-making areas  
3. Correlated inventory days with total profit (Python)  
4. Built Tableau dashboard with filters for region, product type, and season  

## 📈 Deliverables
- Tableau dashboard (to be built)
- `sql/queries.sql`
- `python/analysis.py`
- 2-page report (`report/Project_Report.pdf`)
- Presentation (`presentation/Project_Presentation.pptx`)

## 🎯 Insights
Found relationships between inventory turnover and profit margin, helping retailers target slow-moving SKUs.
